### Project overview
- Purpose: brief description of a Streamlit app that loads a pre-trained model and predicts loan approval from user inputs.
- Features: interactive form, manual encoding, scaler-based preprocessing, single-click prediction.
- Architecture note: model, scaler, and optional label encoder loaded from a pickle tuple.

### Repository structure
- app.py (or app-3.py): Streamlit UI and inference logic.
- loan_approval_model.pkl: expected tuple (model, scaler, le).
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

### Technical requirements
- Python version: recommend 3.10+ (ensure scikit-learn compatibility).
- Dependencies: streamlit, scikit-learn==1.7.1, pandas, numpy, pymysql.
- OS: Linux, macOS, Windows.
- Model artifact: loan_approval_model.pkl available at project root.

### Installation
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Place loan_approval_model.pkl in the repository root.

### Running locally
- Command: streamlit run app.py (or streamlit run app-3.py).
- Access via the local URL provided by Streamlit.

### Input schema and encodings
- Document each field and encoding: gender, married, dependents, education, self_employed, incomes, loan_amount, loan_term, credit_history, property_area.[1]
- Specify encoding maps and that a scaler.transform is applied before prediction.

### Model contract
- Pickle contents and order: (model, scaler, le).
- Required methods: model.predict, scaler.transform; le currently unused.

### Deployment
- Streamlit Community Cloud: file naming (app.py), requirements.txt usage, adding model file.
- Optional Docker guidance: copy app, requirements, and pickle; run streamlit.
